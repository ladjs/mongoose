## Install

[npm][]:

```sh
npm install @ladjs/mongoose mongoose
```

[yarn][]:

```sh
yarn add @ladjs/mongoose mongoose
```

Requires mongoose v6 to be a dependency in your project.


## Usage

This package is a mongoose connection helper that sets up some sensible default connection options for mongoose and event dubugging helpers.

The default options are outlined below.

This package also provides reconnection logic on the initial connection. This is especcially convenient as this is not baked into mongo or mongoose natively. Mongoose will, however, take over reconnection in the event there is a disconnect event.

> Usage:

```js
const Mongoose = require('@ladjs/mongoose');
const mongoose = new Mongoose({
  // ...
});

(async () => {
  await mongoose.connect();
})();
```

Now require and use the mongoose singleton in the rest of your project as you normally would.

```js
const mongoose = require('mongoose');
```
